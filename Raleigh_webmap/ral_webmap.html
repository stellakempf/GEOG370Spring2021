In the original photo, this point lie in between two major roads, but the point itself was situated in the middle of a neighborhood. Since that time, the city has constructed an overlapping intersection at this point, which is the only one that can be found in the downtown Raleigh area. The intersection is made up of Western Blvd, South Saunders St, and South McDowell St. South Saunders and McDowell existed in the original Raleigh photo, but Western Blvd was built after the image was taken. <br/><img src='https://dtraleigh.com/images/five_horizons_saunders/five_horizons_pd_saunders_map1.jpg'width='100px'/>";

As you can see when you compare the OSM layer to the Raleigh Map layer, the layout of the entire park has changed, including where the trees and grass are, as well as where the sidewalks are located. I though this point was interesting to choose because Moore Square is the most popular downtown Raleigh greenspace, and the recent renovations have made it even more popular than once before. <br/><img src='https://www.cbs17.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2019/08/Moore-Square-sky-eye-17-1.jpg'width='100px'/>";

      var Popup3 = "The N.C. State Capital has not undergone many changes over the years, but I think that is interesting to note given it is the building with the most name recognition in the Raleigh area. It is considered to be located in the central part of downtown, and all other buildings, roads, and parks extend from this point. I do not foresee there being much change in this area over time, except for small renovations, because the building has been there since 1840. I included this point because I think it is important to remember that even though cities grow and change over time, there are some things that will always be left untouched. <br/><img src='https://assets.simpleviewinc.com/simpleview/image/fetch/q_75/https://assets.simpleviewinc.com/simpleview/image/upload/crm/raleigh/NC-State-Capitol-29_7b223d0b-9ef5-18dc-e5c70fa4eebb3ab4.jpg'width='100px'/>";
