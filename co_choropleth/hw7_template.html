<h1>Homework 7: Census data choropleth </h1>
<h2>Stella Kempf</h2>
<h3>This map is a choropleth map that shows the number of people in each county of the state of Colorado
    that has recieved a Bachelor's degree or higher. The lightest green color on the map represents counties
    with the fewest number of people with a Bachelor's degree or higher, while the darkest color green represents
    counties with the most number of people with a Bachelor's degree or higher. The dataset represents the 
    TOTAL number of people with a Bachelor's degree or higher, so the legend is in whole numbers instead of percentages.
