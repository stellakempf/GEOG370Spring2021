<h1>Homework 9: Make a choropleth or proportional symbol map </h1>
<h2>Stella Kempf</h2>
<h3>This map is a choropleth map that shows the average precipitation in the state of Wisconsin
    every August. The data collected to find this average was taken each August from 1901-2001.
    I chose to look at average precipitation because I have always been interested in weather (the
    first GEOG course I took at UNC was Weather and Climate). Additionally, I chose the state of
    Wisconsin because it seemed to have the most variation according to the NOAA website and I 
    knew this variation would be helpful when creating a choropleth map. One thing that I found
    really interesting about the average precipitation rates was that the counties closest to lake
    Michigan recieved the smallest amounts of rainfall during the month of August.
